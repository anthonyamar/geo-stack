# Geo stack
Geo stack is an opiniated Rails stack to build a modern website without the need to deal with the configuration hell.

It was extracted from a project that is providing geo-based data insight for travelers. Thus the PG configuration using geo and search extensions.

Except the geo and search features, this stack is pretty "Rails standard", I mean "DHH standard", thus "Geo stack" ðŸ˜„.

## The stack
- Ruby 3.4.x
- Rails 8.0.x
- Postgresql with Postgis, Pgtrgm, Plpsql and Fuzzystrmatch
- Rgeo suite for geo data manipulation
- Pg search and jaro winkler gems for fuzzy search
- TailwindCSS 4 with DaisyUI 5 and Flowbite 3
- ViewComponent
- Stimulus JS
- Turbo 8
- Active Storage
- Importmap
- Devise
- Minitest
- Capybara
- Rubocop
- Mapbox and Leaflet
- PWA ready
- CI ready with Github Actions
- Production ready using Docker (Dockerfile only)
- Cursor ready with full prompt in /.cursor
- Translation ready for FR and EN
- SEO ready using FriendlyId and sitemap_generator

Yet:
- Solid queue
- Solid cache
- Turbo Native iOS and Android template

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:anthonyamar/geo-stack.git new-app
cd new-app
```

2. Rename the Origin remote url, so you can still merge changes in the futur
```bash
git remote rename origin geo-stack
```

3. Add your origin url (change the git@github.com link for yours)
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new-app.git
```

4. Rename the app
Find and replace all `GeoStack` and `geo_stack` with your app name (e.g. `NewApp` and `new_app`)

## Setup and run
Run bin/setup to bundle, yarn install, figaro install, prepare db, and restart server.
```bash
bin/setup
```

Run your server
```bash
bin/dev
```

Visit (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000/] and Yay ðŸŽ‰, you're on Rails !

## Configuration and libs
### Theme configuration
Use the [DaisyUI Theme Generator](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/) to make your theme, then replace the config in `application.tailwind.css`. You can also tweak heading, paragraph, link and Pagy style in this file.

You can change Tailwind configuration, i.e. colors, spacing, radius, fonts in `tailwind.config.js`. This kind of config is a legacy from Tailwind 3. It works well, but could be changed for a full CSS approach as suggested in Tailwind 4 docs.

### FontAwesome
Add your FontAwesome kit in `application.html.erb` to get icon classes.

### SEO and Sitemap
Fill the `config/meta.yml` with all the details to enable meta-tags. You can find an example on how to define meta-tags on a per page basis in `app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb`

Add the URL and collection that you want to have in your sitemap.xml in `config/sitemap.rb` then run
```bash
ruby sitemap.rb
```

### Using geo and search concerns in model
You can include four concerns to get the most of PG extensions. For the example, let's say you have a City model.

Use any or all by adding it in your model:
```ruby
class City < ApplicationRecord
  include GeoCoordinates
  include GeoBoundingBox
  include Geocoderable
  include FuzzySearchable
  # ...
end
```
#### `GeoCoordinates` and `GeoBoundingBox`
These will expose methods for geo-search, like `nearby?`, `nearby()`, `contains?`. You'll need to add geo fields to your model.

In your migration:
```ruby
add_column :cities, :lonlat, :st_point, geographic: true
add_column :cities, :bounding_box_geom, :geometry, geographic: true
add_index :cities, :lonlat, using: :gist
add_index :cities, :bounding_box_geom, using: :gist
```

I advise you to also have the original coordinates as normal float. Not mandatory, but handy sometimes:
```ruby
add_column :destinations, :original_latitude, :float
add_column :destinations, :original_longitude, :float
```

#### `Geocoderable`
Will fetch the result of Geocoder search once, store it in a jsonb field and serves it for you as an OpenStruct when needed. It is meant to increase performances when accessing geo-data without redundancy.

You can force reloading Geocoder config by adding doing `city.save(store_geocoder_data: true)`.

In your migration:
```ruby
add_column :cities, :geocoder_data, :jsonb, default: {}, null: false
add_index :cities, :geocoder_data, using: :gin
```

Then use, i.e `city.geocoder_data.country` to access all the Geocoder methods outputing data.

#### `FuzzySearchable`
Expose a `fuzzy_search_by` class methods so you can do something like:
```ruby
# fuzzy_search_by(attributes, value, threshold: nil, limit: 10)
User.fuzzy_search_by("name", "Kylian", threshold: 0.8, limit: 3)
# => ActiveRecord Collection
# Kylian
# Kyllian
# Kyliann
```

In your migration, index the attributes that you will query:
```ruby
add_index :cities, :name, using: :gin, opclass: :gin_trgm_ops
add_index :users, :name, using: :gin, opclass: :gin_trgm_ops
add_index :users, :email, using: :gin, opclass: :gin_trgm_ops
```

## Production
### Master key
You may need to generate a Rails master key for your production environment.
```bash
rm config/credentials.yml.enc config/master.key
rails credentials:edit
```
Then, fill your `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable in production with new one created at `config/master.key`

## Merging updates
Merge changes from the `geo-stack`remote configured above:
```bash
git fetch geo-stack
git fetch geo-stack/main
```
